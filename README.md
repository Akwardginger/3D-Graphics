## Log 3D model

In my 3D Graphics/3D Animation class we were tasked with creating a building in a 3D space as well as a 3D landscape to place it in. We worked with textures, lighting, and experimented with tools in the program Maya. The 3D landscape was made in Mudbox.

## Cereal Box Commercial

In my 3D Graphics/3D animation class we were told to create a 3D model of a cereal box and a kitchen to place it inside of. The goal was to make it resemble an old 2000's tv commercial. The graohics on the box were made in Photoshop and the scene was made in Maya.
